NHS Diagnostic Analysis Using Python

Week 1

My Github was set up with a main branch and a branch called Weekly Update Branch. Pull requests will be made to merge update from the Weekly Udpate Branch to the Main Branch.

Github enables data analysts to store their own working codes, while at the same time allowing teams to contribute to collaborative work with proper version controls. In particular, Github enables storage of different versions of one set of code base, so that each team member can extract a specific version of the codes for his own development, then merge updates with the original codes through pull requests to the main branch.
